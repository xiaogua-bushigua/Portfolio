Making websites interactive is cool, so I decided to build my portfolio in a way that lets you explore it like a game.

There are some simple operating instructions:

- Hold the left mouse button to rotate the view.
- Double-click the left mouse button to update the map.
- Hover over the gift box to view the project overview.
- Click on the icons in the information card to visit the project demo page and the GitHub repository.
